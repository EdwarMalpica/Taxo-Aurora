## Prompt

Develop a one-page React web app that displays weather information for multiple cities simultaneously. It should also allow the user to add or remove cities and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Include a search functionality to find cities easily.

## Features (Outro)

This weather dashboard includes the following features:

1. Add and remove cities
2. Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit
3. Responsive grid layout
4. City search with autocomplete
5. Weather cards showing:
   - Temperature
   - Weather condition with icon
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed
6. Loading state
7. Persistent city list using `localStorage`

**Note:** This example uses simulated weather data. In a real application, you would need to:

1. Connect to a weather API (like [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) or [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/))
2. Handle API keys securely using environment variables
3. Implement proper error handling for API calls
4. Use a proper cities database or geocoding API for the search functionality

Would you like me to add any specific features or make any adjustments to the current implementation?

Prompt:
Build a React reading time estimator that calculates completion time based on page count and reading speed.

Outro:

This reading time estimator includes the following features:

1. Input field for page count
2. Slider for reading speed (pages per hour)
3. Estimated reading time displayed in minutes

The reading time is calculated using the formula: reading time (minutes) = page count / reading speed * 60.

The reading speed slider allows users to adjust the reading speed based on their preferences. The estimated reading time updates in real-time as the user changes the page count or reading speed.

Would you like me to add any specific features or make any adjustments to the current implementation?

Prompt:
Build a React/TypeScript web app that allows users to search for movies, view details, and write reviews.

Chaing of thought:
<Thinking>
1. Structure:
  - Main component for the movie search app
  - Search bar component for movie search
  - Movie list component for search results
  - Movie details component for detailed view
  - Review form component for writing reviews
  - Review list component for displaying reviews
  - Pagination component for search results
  - Error boundary component for error handling

2. Features:
  - Search for movies by title
  - Display search results with movie details
  - View detailed information about a movie
  - Write and submit reviews for movies
  - Display reviews for each movie
  - Pagination for search results
  - Error boundary for handling errors

3. Styling:
  - Clean and modern design
  - Use of images for movie posters
  - Color-coded rating system for reviews
  - Responsive layout for different screen sizes

4. State Management:
  - React state for search query and movie details
  - Local storage for user reviews
  - Error handling for invalid inputs
  - Loading state for data fetching

</Thinking>

Outro:

This movie search app includes the following features:
- Search for movies by title
- Display search results with movie details
- View detailed information about a movie
- Write and submit reviews for movies
- Display reviews for each movie
- Pagination for search results
- Error boundary for handling errors
- Clean and modern design
- Use of images for movie posters

The app uses React for state management and local storage for storing user reviews. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs and a loading state for data fetching.

Note: This example uses simulated movie data. In a real application, you would need to connect to a movie database API (like [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)) and handle API keys securely using environment variables.

Would you like me to add any specific features or make any adjustments to the current implementation?
